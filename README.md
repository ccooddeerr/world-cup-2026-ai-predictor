# FIFA World Cup 2026 Prediction Agent

TypeScript agent that predicts FIFA World Cup 2026 match outcomes, group standings, and tournament winners using an ensemble of Elo, Poisson, and form-based models.

## Features

- **Match predictions** — win/draw/loss probabilities and expected goals
- **Group standings** — simulated points tables from predicted results
- **Tournament simulation** — projected champion and semifinalists
- **Value bet detection** — compare model vs market odds with Kelly sizing
- **Agent tools** — extensible tool-based prediction orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run forecast -- predict A1
npm run forecast -- standings
npm run forecast -- tournament
npm run forecast -- value-bets
npm test
```

## Models

| Model | Weight | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Elo | 35% | Rating-based win probability with home advantage |
| Poisson | 30% | Goal distribution from attack/defense strength |
| Form | 20% | Recent results momentum score |
| Squad | 15% | Squad market value strength (optional) |
